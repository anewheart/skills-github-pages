#RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
 
##Orion Space Solutions	September 2023 - Present
Ionospheric Researcher
-Evaluated a data assimilation model as an ionospheric forecasting tool and added features to the model in Python
-Validated remote sensing data (40GB in netCDF format) for the NASA Commercial Satellite Data Acquisition program by comparing to existing ground- and space-based observations to climatology
-Developed a CubeSat mission concept to examine mid- to low-latitude ionospheric irregularities
-Used statistical methods in Python to analyze plasma wave observations and develop a space debris detection method
##National Center for Atmospheric Research	October 2022 - September 2023
Advanced Study Program Postdoctoral Fellow
-Investigated the effects of geomagnetic storms using a coupled whole geospace model run on a high-performance computing system and compared these results to ground-based radar observations
-Examined long-term changes in the upper atmosphere using a whole atmosphere model and subtracting seasonal trends using MATLAB
##Rice University								           August 2016 - July 2022
Graduate Research Assistant
-Used spectral methods to identify and characterize atmospheric waves in a large dataset (20-30GB per day of data in HDF5 format) from a distributed ground-based sensor network
-Analyzed the occurrence of ionospheric irregularities using Langmuir probe data from multiple satellites (International Space Station Floating Potential Meter Unit, Swarm and DMSP)
-Examined the physical drivers behind ionospheric irregularities using model-data comparison to better forecast their occurrence 

##NASA Goddard Space Flight Center	                              			           June 2014 - August 2016
DREAM2 Project Intern
-Reanalyzed Apollo era plasma data from the surface of the moon and developed procedures for identifying relevant data for statistical analysis of particle spectra using MATLAB

#LEADERSHIP EXPERIENCE
 
##Rice University	April 2020 - April 2021
Graduate Student Association Vice President of Student Advocacy
-Advocated for graduate student needs at the university level including university policy decisions and development projects
