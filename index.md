I am an ionospheric researcher at Orion Space Solutions with experience studying a variety of topics in ionospheric physics and magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. I am interested in developing CubeSat mission concepts to study ionospheric irregularities. I am also interested in using data assimilation models to forecast the effects of geomagnetic storms. In addition to research, I've been involved in advocacy against sexual violence and gender discrimination in academia.
